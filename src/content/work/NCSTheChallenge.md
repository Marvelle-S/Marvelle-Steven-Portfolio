- I spent a summer working for NCS the challenge Leeds to which tasked me with caring for the elderly.
- My engagement with others and need to properly organize my surroundings for the care and safety of others were tried and tested over this period
- Through the help of others and properly managing our time for more important time sensitive tasks, we were able to be of the best possible help
