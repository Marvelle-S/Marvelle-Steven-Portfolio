I am a technically versatile developer, 3d artist and project planner with an extended year and 2 months of industry experience at The Walt Disney Company. 


I find most of my enjoyment in new technologies, creative outlets and sharing knowledge with my peers. 

Within this portfolio, you'll find my  exploits as an MComp (Hons) Computer Science with Games Engineering student at Newcastle University; predicted for a First-Class Honours. I thrive to bridge the gap between technical artistry and software engineering.
