title: Willow - The Owl House Artwork
description: >-
  A fanart project that took me a week and 3 days to complete. This is a sculpt artwork made completely from scratch, from 2d character concept to final render. The project was completed using Blender for modeling and rendering, with final touch-ups done in Gimp/Krita.
